This is a solution to the Product Preview Card Component challenge on Frontend Mentor. The challenge was to build out a product preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.

See a hover state on the "Add to Cart" button.

## My process
### Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup: Using appropriate tags like <main>, <section>, and <div> to create a logical and accessible structure.

CSS custom properties: For a more manageable and reusable stylesheet.

Flexbox: For creating a flexible and responsive layout.

CSS Grid: Could be used for specific layout needs, especially for the main card structure.

Mobile-first workflow: Designing and styling for smaller screens first, then progressively enhancing the layout for larger screens.

### What I learned
This project was a great opportunity to practice foundational front-end skills. I focused on:

Responsive design: Making sure the card adapts gracefully to different screen sizes. I learned how to use CSS media queries effectively to change the layout between mobile and desktop views.

Styling with Flexbox: Reinforcing my understanding of Flexbox properties like flex-direction, align-items, and justify-content to center and align elements.

CSS Box Model: Solidifying my knowledge of margin, padding, and border to control spacing and layout.
